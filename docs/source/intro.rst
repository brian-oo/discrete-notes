Discrete vs. Continuous
-----------------------


Hi. Welcome to EECS 203, Discrete Mathematics. In this class, we will study an introduction to discrete mathematics. `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics>`_ defines discrete math as 

    the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying "smoothly", the objects studied in discrete mathematics -- such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic -- do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, seperated values. Discrete mathematics therefore exclused topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus or Euclidean geometry.

Most math classes you may have taken up to this point are continuous, which makes sense because we live in a continuous world. The real world is not discrete in any manner really, Picasso painted with brushstrokes --not pixels, you can not parse Lake Michigan up by its drops, the temperature of a room is dictated by the continous flow of energy in and around in an infinite amount of particles.

However, looking up an image of a Picasso on the internet, no matter how high resolution, will lead you to a pool of pixels, each uniquely defined with a color value. As we approach the world of EECS, information becomes entirely digital. Data is discrete, time occurs in discrete steps, memory, programs, circuits, networks, algorithms are all *discrete*. 

It is this intersection of math and EECS where we find discrete mathematics, where at the end of the day, everything in computer science is a ``1`` or a ``0``. It is with discrete math, we attempt to understand this digital world; just as Newton and Leibniz invented calculus to explain their natural world, we will use discrete math to explain the digital world.

Course Topics
-------------

In this course, we will cover the following topics:

- Logic
- Proofs
- Discrete Structures
- Counting and Probability
- Algorithm Analysis
- Number Theory

These topics form the basis of most of concepts in modern computing, and we will attempt to extend beyond discrete mathematics to show examples and extensions of these topics whenever possible. Understanding discrete math will help you succeed in most every EECS course you may take going forward:

- Hardware design is boolean logic.
- Every program, at its core, is a proof. Every proof, at its core, is a program. Understanding how to make strong programs is synonmyous with understanding how to make strong proofs.
- Modelling modern data requires discrete structures: sets, graphs, relations are the heart of modern computing.
- Counting and probability are used throughout computing, and have an impact as small as error liklihood to as large as fundamental machine learning algorithms
- Analyzing algorithms is the heart of coding, and most of EECS 281 relies on scalablity complexity analysis.
- Number theory forms the backbone of many special topics in computing: cryptography, random number generation, hash functions, graphics, data structures, and more.

A lot of people claim EECS 203 is a useless class where you will never need any of the information ever again. I agree in part. You will never need to understand even 10% of every topic we go over. However, you will need to completely understand, inside-and-out, 10% of the topics we cover. Which portion of topics you will need to know? It is up to you.

.. Note::
    These notes are not designed to be a substitute for lecture. Additionally, these notes may cover topics that will not be explicitly covered in class, nor will these notes be guaranteed to cover every topic that will be tested on in class. These notes are designed to serve a supplementary purpose at the guideance of its handsome author.

    This is an EECS Extension

This should be after. I think it works.
