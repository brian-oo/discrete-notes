Propositions
------------

In order to begin our journey in any proof-based math class, we must start with the building block: propositions. If logic and proofs were a house, propositions are the bricks. A **proposition** is a declarative statement that is either *true* or *false*. Propositions must be true or false, and can not be neither true nor false, nor be both true and false. Propositions are strictly binary and must maintain only one truth value at a time.

       Requiring propositions be either true or false, not neither or both, is more than a math principle. Propositions in the coding world can be considered as ``boolean`` where at any given point your ``boolean`` is true/false, but never nothing nor both. This extends even further, down to the hardware. On a circuitry level, wires and transistors can either be on or off. This is determined through voltage levels. Most transistors have a threshold voltage, such that once a particular wire reaches a threshold voltage, the transistor turns on. Gather thousands of silicon transistors together, and you just made a microprocessor.


The other major component of a proposition is that it be a declarative statement. Exclamatory statements, such as "Wow!" have no truth value, nor do questions, such as "Is it raining?" It may seem natural to think the answer to the question represents the truth value, however the question itself does not have a truth value. The statement "It is raining right now" does maintain an active truth value, and is therefore a proposition.  

Note that we do not have to know the truth value of a proposition to consider it a proposition. "Aliens exist" is a proposition, however we do not know its truth value. Nonetheless we can still use propositional logic on this proposition, despite not knowing its exact truth value. **Axioms** are propositions, that we assume to be true and are assumed to be true at all times, such as :math:`1 + 1 = 2`.

**Sample Problem**

Which of the following are propositions: 

1. A square has 4 sides.
2. All rectangles are squares.
3. Is a rectangle a square?
4. This statement is false.
5. :math:`8 \cdot 2 = 16`
6. :math:`8 \cdot x = 16`

        1. Proposition, its truth value is true.  
        2. Proposition, its truth value is false.
        3. Not a Proposition, questions do not have a truth value.
        4. Not a Proposition, paradoxes do not have a definite truth value.
        5. Proposition, its truth value is true.
        6. Not a Proposition. This is a predicate.

----

Number 6 is tricky. :math:`8 \cdot x = 16` is a proposition only if we have a value for :math:`x`. At the moment, the statement is a predicate because we are unsure what :math:`x` is. If :math:`x` was a sandwich, then the proposition :math:`8 \cdot x = 16` makes no sense. Only once we define posible values (domain) for :math:`x` then we can claim there is a truth value. "Given that :math:`x` is a real number, :math:`8 \cdot x = 16`" is a proposition since although we do not know if the value of :math:`x` , we know that the statement is either true or false, thus making it a proposition. 

---------------------
Compound Propositions
---------------------

In order to simplify logical expressions, we can use letters: such as :math:`p, q, r` to represent propositions. Let's say we have propositions: :math:`p =` "*It rained today*" and :math:`q =` "*I brought my umbrella today*". How could we express the logical statement: "*It rained today and I brought my umbrella.*" We could define a new proposition, :math:`r` to represent this statement, however this will get tedious the more and more expressions we have. The way to combine propositions is with logical operators.

If we want to express both the logical expression of both :math:`p` and :math:`q`, we use the *and* operator: :math:`\wedge`. Therefore, to represent the statement "*It rained today and I brought my umbrella*": :math:`p \wedge q`.

Translating between logic and English at times can be unclear and ambigious and so we use **truth tables** to clearly define the meaning of a compound proposition. A truth table is a representation of truth values for a compound propositions given truth values for the base propositions. 

Compound propositions, just like regular propositions, must maintain only one truth value at a time, however that truth value may change depending on the truth value of the base propositions it's made out of. Typically, all possible input combinations are depicted in the truth table. If a compound proposition has :math:`n` different base propositions, then the truth table to fully represent it will need :math:`2^n` rows.

.. admonition:: Or vs. Xor

    In logic we have two ways to express the English word "*or*". This is because there are some instances where we need an inclusive-or or an exclusive-or (xor). For example, the or in "*Today or tomorrow is her birthday*" is an exclusive-or since both situations can not both be true. Meanwhile the or in "*Would you like cream or sugar*" is inclusive because wanting cream, sugar, or both would all be valid responses.

.. tip:: 
    Implication is naturally unintuitive. Saying that if :math:`p` then :math:`q` suggests that there is a causal relationship between :math:`p` and :math:`q`, however we must obey the truth table for implications. The proposition ":math:`(0 = 1) \rightarrow` *pigs can fly*" is true. This is because :math:`(0 = 1)` is false and "*pigs can fly*" is false, and according to the truth table  :math:`F \rightarrow F = T`. It takes practice to intuitively understand how implications work. 

    * If :math:`p` is true, then the truth value of :math:`p \rightarrow q` depends on :math:`q`.
    * If :math:`p` is false, then the truth value of :math:`p \rightarrow q` is true, no matter what :math:`q` is.
    * It may help to look from the false perspective: :math:`p \rightarrow q` is false **only** if :math:`p` is true and :math:`q` is false.

----

**Sample Problem**

Let :math:`p, q` and :math:`r` be the propositions:

* :math:`p`: "*You walk the dog*."
* :math:`q`: "*You go on a run*."
* :math:`r`: "*You eat ice cream*."

Represent each of the following statements into compound propositions:

1. You did not go on a run.
2. You eat ice cream, but you did not walk the dog.
3. You walking the dog and going on a run is sufficient for eating ice cream.

        2. :math:`r \wedge \neg q`
        3. :math:`(p \wedge q) \rightarrow r`

--------------------
Logical Equivalances
--------------------

Two propositions are considered the same if they are **logically equivalent**, meaning that they mean the exact same thing in terms of logic. This means that given an input of propositions with truth values, the two propositions will always result in the same truth value. **Tautologies** are propositions that are always true, while **contradictions** are tautologies that are always false. 

Take the proposition :math:`\neg p \vee p`. Either :math:`p` is true or false, meaning that one side of this or statement is true at any given time, meaning the entire compound proposition will equate to true. This means that this proposition is a tautology and is logically equivalent to true. The proposition :math:`\neg p \wedge p` is a contradiction, since there is no scenario with :math:`p` is true *and* false. 

A proposition is **satisfiable** if there is some set of input that make the proposition true. A proposition is never both a contradiction and satisfiable. 

Some propositions are very complex, yet we still need to see if they are logical equivalences. To do so, we can either use truth tables or logical identities to prove logical equivalance.

Truth Tables
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two compound propositions are logically equivalent if and only if they have the same truth table. Let's try to see if these two statements are logically equivalent: 

* :math:`p` = "*If it's sunny, then I'm outside*"
* :math:`q` = "*It's not sunny or I'm outside*"
* Let :math:`a` = "*It's sunny*"
* Let :math:`b` = "*I'm outside*"

We can translate these statements into compound propositions:

* :math:`p = a \rightarrow b`.
* :math:`q = \neg a \vee b`.

Now we can use a truth table to see if these result in the same output for every input:

    T         T         T                           T
    T         F         F                           F
    F         T         T                           T
    F         F         T                           T
    ========= ========= =========================== =========================

Since the :math:`p` and :math:`q` columns are identical, the propositions are logically equivalent.

Logical Identities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A truth table works great for small compound propositions without many different elementary propositions; however, as these propositions get larger, it will require larger and more complex truth tables to fully prove logical equivalance. The other method we use to prove logical equivalances is with **logical identities** (equivalance laws). Just as in algebra, you can use distributive, commutative, associative, and many other laws to simplify equations, we can use equivalance laws to simplify propositions.

        Combining propositions to create logical equivalances can also be seen through logic circuits. In logic circuits, propositions represent 1s and 0s values, rather than true and false. Additionally, in order to combine values, we use gates that represent the same logical operators we defined earlier (OR, NOT, AND, XOR). Two or more inputs go into a gate, and out comes the result according to the circuit gate. These logic circuits form the basis of combinational logic and logic design. Below is a sample logic gate as well as it's propositional equivalances.

        In logic design, we typically use mathematical symbols, like ``+``, ``*``, and ``'`` to represent OR, AND, and NOT respectively, however all of the logical principles learned in propositional logic still hold. We can also use logical equivalances, such as through truth tables or logical identities to simplify outputs. For example, the output in our circuit above is :math:`(\neg ( \neg p \wedge q ) \vee r ) \wedge ( \neg p \wedge q )`, however we can simplify this to :math:`r \wedge \neg p \wedge q`. For math purposes, this doesn't do much besides making the proposition cleaner and easier to work with, however on a hardware level, where each gate costs power and money, simplifying expressions to require as few gates as possible is very important.
