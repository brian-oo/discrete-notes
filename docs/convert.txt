The universal quantifier, represented by the symbol $$ \forall $$, spoken as "*for all*" represents every element. $$ \forall x P(x) $$ represents "*Everyone will buy an umbrella*". This can be conceptualized as $$ P(x_1) \wedge P(x_2) \wedge P(x_3) \wedge ... $$ , since for every element $$ x $$, they must buy an umbrella. 

Whenever we say for all $$ x $$, we must define the **domain of discourse** (also called the universe of discourse). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_discourse) defines the domain of discourse as
> the set of entities over which certain variables of interest in some formal treatment may range. In first-order logic, the domain of discourse is the set of individuals over which the quantifiers range.

Without defining the domain of discourse, predicates are ambigious. In $$ \forall x P(x) $$, $$ x $$ itself be anything, however by specifying the domain of discourse, we can specify our domain as all people, people in this class, pets of people in this class.
